<div>Overrides the default endpoint for this client. Callers can use this method to control which AWS region they want to work with.
    This method is not threadsafe. Endpoints should be configured when the client is created and before any service requests are made. Changing it afterwards creates inevitable race conditions for any service requests in transit.

    Callers can pass in just the endpoint (ex: "ec2.amazonaws.com") or a full URL, including the protocol (ex: "https://ec2.amazonaws.com"). If the protocol is not specified here, the default protocol from this client's ClientConfiguration will be used, which by default is HTTPS.
