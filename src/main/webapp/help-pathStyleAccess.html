    <p>Enable Path-Style Access to S3.</p>
    <p>The difference is as follows (assuming bucket name of "johnsmith.net"):
        <ul>
    <li>Host-Style Access: <code>https://johnsmith.net.s3.amazonaws.com/homepage.html</code></li>
    <li>Path-Style Access: <code>https://s3.amazonaws.com/johnsmith.net/homepage.html</code></li>
</ul>
Some on-premesis S3 systems may require path-style access due to certificate handling, or network policies.
