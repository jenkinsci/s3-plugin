    When checked or selected, the build status will not get updated when a failure occurs.
    This is primarily useful when using this step in a pipeline. A failure would manifest itself
    as an exception thrown as opposed to a change in build status. Therefore, the pipeline author can
    choose to decide to handle the exception with a retry(), etc.
